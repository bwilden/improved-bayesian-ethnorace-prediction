# Bayesian Prediction for Ethnicity and Race

This repository contains the companion paper for [**bper**](https://github.com/bwilden/bper), a Bayesian imputation algorithm developed to improve the accuracy of race/ethnicity predictions in social science research. The paper outlines the methodology used in **bper** and provides predictive performance metrics validated with 23 million observations from the combined North Carolina and Florida voter file. Additionally, we replicate the results of Grumbach and Sahn (2020)[^1] and compare their findings to those obtained using **bper**.
